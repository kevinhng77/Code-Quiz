# Code-Quiz

## Description 

This is a project that tests my skills in terms of combining a lot of the things that we've been learning for the past two weeks. Although this project is mainly Javascript focused, there are a lot of things that the CSS and HTML are still needed for. For example, if you were to just look at the backbone of the structure of the quiz, then it is all HTML. The HTML provides the skeleton for how the site needs to work. However, one important distinction is that this is way more Javascript focused, meaning that there will be more emphasis on isolating the variables. Compared to the other projects, where we can alter the states within the HTML file or the CSS file, the Javascript file allows us to isolate variables individually, and that is super important when it comes to wanting custom things done for the page.

## Installation

First, by cloning the repository down to your computer, you can copy down the existing index.html file. Next, open it up with GitBash and type in "code ." , which should open up VSCode. From there, there were a lot of errors and things that needed to be fixed, which will be went over in the next section.


## Usage 

Looking at the top of the page, there should be a timer that counts down. As you begin to start the quiz, it will start counting down, and the objective of this game is to answer as many correct answers as possible before the timer runs out. It is important to know this because if you were to answer the question incorrectly, then you will get punished by the time running down.


## Credits

Special shoutout to TA Kyle Vance for assisting me with this project. He helped me learn the structure in which files should be presented in Github, as well as figure out some things about how variables and things work in Javascript.
